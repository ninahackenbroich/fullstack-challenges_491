## Coding Interview - Review and Refactor

TODO:
We provide a Rails and the student has to:

  - Refactor routes
  - Refactor the controller (if/else, bad_naming, no before_action, long logic...)
      - use scopes / concerns / AR callbacks
      - Solve n+1 queries
  - Use a service object
  - Add some tests
  - Refactor views with partials, bad indentation
